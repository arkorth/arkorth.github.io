        </h3>
        <p>
            Hi! I am a junior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison majoring in Risk 
            Management and Insurance and Information Systems. Like many of you, I have a busy 
            schedule and am always on the go. However, I still like to take time to cook fun 
            and healthy meals.

            I hope to inspire other college students to take the time to cook fun meals and value 
            their health. These are some of my favorite recipes and I hope everyone enjoys them 
            as well! 
        </p>
